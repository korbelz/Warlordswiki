## How to download the mission to run locally

On this github page press the <> code button on top of the page.

Once on the main project page press the green code button.

Download as zip.

unzip the file to your arma 3 profile mission folder.
normal location: C:\Users\<your name here>\Documents\Arma 3\missions

if you don't have a mission folder, right click then create new folder and name it missions.

The mission you downloaded is specific to the profile you downloaded it to. The example above is for the default profile when you installed arma the first time. If you prefer to play/edit the mission on a different profile download the file here: 
Other profile location:  C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\<profile name>\missions

Open up arma 3, select correct profile on upper right of the main menu.

Select singleplayer menu then editor.

Select altis map.(warlords redux is set on altis by default)

Select scenario then open your mission. If you don't see the mission on the list your are most likely on the wrong profile or might need to double check where you downloaded the mission.  

Once the mission is open in the editor. Select play menu at the top and Play in multiplayer(MP). DO NOT PLAY IN SINGLE PLAYER it breaks everything. 


## How to host a mission for your friends

Open up the scenario in the editor, remember to select mission folder not MP missions.(unless you downloaded the mission file to MP missions, which is fine)

Click the play button down at the bottom right of the editor.


## How to download the mission to a server

Follow the top directions to download the mission from github.

unzip the file to where you keep mission files for your server. 

It should work out of the box with no setup required. 

Highly recommend using FASTER to host your own dedicated server. Playing Warlords on a dedicated server is the best way to play even if you are solo.
